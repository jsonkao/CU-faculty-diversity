The story isn't around the untenured to tenured data; it's around the tenure-track.

# Ideation

We want to make sure the "reality overlayed" is hammered into the reader. We need concrete feedback, like:
- How many people drew a more accurate picture of reality?
- Slope of the line, and why it was right or wrong. Should it have been steeper? (Intro should include background on University efforts.)

_Idea: an actual leaking pipeline. Have color-coded dots that "leak" out of the main pipeline as we advance faculty status. (But remember, the MVP is still just the you-draw-it's.)_

_Idea: Collect statistics on guessed answers._

# Data

Data was taken from the Office of the Provost ([source](https://provost.columbia.edu/content/faculty-diversity)). Raw data was unavailable to download, so I took screenshots of data tables, converted them to Excel files with an [online OCR](https://www.onlineocr.net/), and combined those with Python and pandas.
